Things had changed a great deal since Alatos was carried off by the drakes; for one thing, the dwarves had been digging very industriously in search of minerals, so they had expanded the cave system considerably. Most of it was now unfamiliar to Alatos."

Dwarves are pretty tough, but not tough enough to walk away unscathed when part of the tunnel roof collapses. So there was a prospector called Augdralith in acting command."
