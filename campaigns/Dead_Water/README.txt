I think this was the campaign where I originally got started with editing
the scenarios of the campaigns I was playing, but I forget what I actually
did. I remember 04 (Slavers) was too hard, but I forget how I made it easier
(turns out it was just gold/turns tweaks). Likewise with 06 (Uncharted Islands)
(again, just gold/turns tweaks) and 10 (The Flaming Sword) (gold/turns tweaks,
plus also more usage of LIMIT_CONTEMPORANEOUS_RECRUITS).
