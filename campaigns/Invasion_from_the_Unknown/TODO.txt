With the update from 2.1.5 to 2.1.9 all my changes got overwritten, so to
restore them I will want to do the following:

1. clone the IftU git repo from GitHub
2. checkout the 2.1.5 tag
3. generate diffs between my changes and the 2.1.5 tag
4. apply the diffs against 2.1.9

(alternatively I could just overwrite the 2.1.9 changes, but idk what exactly
they consist of)
