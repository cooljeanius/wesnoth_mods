Mercenary Band wasn't necessarily a BAD campaign per se, it was just an
unfinished one, one that felt like a rough draft of something with greater
potential. There were some common issues throughout, like generic/bland
writing, and enemy leaders who'd start on keeps much too close to your own.
Note that I didn't actually edit every scenario I noticed issues with, just
ones where I died or otherwise had trouble. Per-scenario notes:

1 Arrival: Just some basic gold tweaks. Probably needs to be modified further
  to make sure the event where Yswen appears fires even if you don't actually
  move to her tile, considering she's a hero throughout the rest of the story.
2 Road through the Swamp: I made the trolls and saurians fight each other here.
4 Revenants: Ok this one was a major pain with the invisible revenants
  constantly popping out of nowhere to attack. Apparently it had been copying
  over code from Eastern Invasion, so when I looked over at the code for the
  scenario it had been copied from, I noticed that only part of the code had
  been copied, and that the author had left out the code that kept the 
  revenants still until they ambushed, so after I copied over that part as
  well, the scenario became much more manageable. I also did some gold tweaks,
  and added an extra row to the map for more space to maneuver.
5 Siege of Elense: This one was mostly AI tweaks, since the enemy AI would
  attack me more than my allied AI, and the allied AI would kill Histen even
  though they're not supposed to.
7 Orc Attack: I added an extra row to this map because it seemed like the top
  was just cut off too abruptly. I also added a few extra villages.
11 The Treaty: again, being ambushed by revenants is annoying, but here I just
  turned down the number of them, which meant that I could leave their ability
  to move invisibly intact, which made more sense here, since it was a
  defensive mission. It probably needs further edits so that you have to
  actually defend the conference, because as it is, the revenants don't even
  try to get in.
