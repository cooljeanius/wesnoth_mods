So yeah this was another hard one. Here's a writeup on my per-scenario changes:

01 Survival: I didn't actually edit this one my first time thru, but in
  retrospect, if I'm going to be making everything easier, I might as well
  start here.
02a Rebellion: I made it so that the hatchlings get wounded less, to try to
  make it easier to keep them alive
03a Manor: un-commented out code that had weakened some of the guardians and
  instead made it guarded by "ifdef EASY"
04a Caravan: I didn't actually edit this one my first time thru, but since I'm
  taking a second pass at this I figure I might as well edit this one, too, for
  completeness.
05a Blue River: Restricted clippers that Omandro can recruit to 1 on EASY
06a Southern Shore: See note for 04a Caravan above.
07a Open Ocean: Likewise.
08 Landfall: OK this one was a pain. The enemies ganged up on me and just
  wrecked me on my first try, so I tweaked their AIs to try to make them fight
  each other more. Also, tweaks to gold, income, and turns.
10 Underground: This one was too chokepoint-y, so I edited the map to make
  some of the corridors wider, and the terrain more passable for drakes.
  I also added some more villages. I also added a (vague) warning for units
  approaching the statue that revives the skeletal dragon so that players will
  maybe get the idea that they might lose a unit and choose an appropriate one
  accordingly. I didn't want to make it TOO scary of a warning, though, as the
  skeletal dragon is definitely worth the sacrifice, and players should still
  definitely go for it.
11 River of Skulls: Somehow the original 100 turn limit wasn't enough for me,
  so in my rage my first reaction was to set the turns as {TURNS 300 200 100}.
  This gave me such a huge early finish bonus when I finished with these edits
  that it made the next few scenarios probably easier than they should have
  been, so I will have to keep tweaking the turn limit here. I also nerfed all
  the enemies majorly and made them fight against each other more, but there
  might have been some bugs with this, as now only the first few golems
  survive, but none of the farther-in ones do. Also I had some problems with
  the spider failing to spawn, but then I made the dwarves avoid it and it
  seems to work again. At least, the spider spawns again, but now it sometimes
  behaves oddly, like for example by moving into the lava and just hanging out
  with the nagas. Also, on EASY, I removed the event where the storeroom
  ceiling caves in on you and kills a unit randomly, because, wtf was that
  doing in there in the first place? (update: apparently it was to discourage
  you from stopping to smell the roses, so I edited the message displayed on
  EASY to that effect.) Finally, because the turn limit is increased, I
  changed the turns on which Kogw gives you your progress notifications.
12 Rockfall: Made the dwarves fight the lava monsters. Also gave the player
  more time to escape.
13 Betrayal: See note for 04a Caravan above.
14 Hordes of the Fould Undead: Likewise.
15 Gate of Storms: Likewise.
16 Exodus: Likewise.
17 Blockade: I tried to make the Merfolk and Nagas focus more on each other
  than the player. Also I've noticed the whole thing where the WML messes with
  the team colors doesn't exactly work, so I might want to change that, both
  here and in other scenarios where it's done similarly.
18 Return to Morogor: I had finally run thru my massive gold reserves left
  over from River of Skulls by this point (on my first playthru), but since
  all my spending of it previously had given me a large recall list, I
  needed to add more gold again to let me actually use it. Also I tweaked the
  AI to try to make the enemy humans protect their leaders more, so that
  they'd fight the arriving AI drakes more than you, but that didn't really
  work. Also I edited the map to add more villages because I needed more
  places to heal.
19 Liberation: I actually debugged my way thru this level originally, instead
  of editing it first, so these edits were untested on my first playthru, but
  I have since tested them on a second playthru. Basically, I needed to up the
  turn limit again, because the original author liked chokepoints too much.
  I might want to edit the map later to widen some of the corridors...
20 Endgame: Mostly gold tweaks. The changes I made to the "enemy gold" event
  varied the amounts too much on difficulty in the changes I did my first
  playthru with, so these newer amounts should now be small enough in terms
  of their differences. I still might want to reduce them again though.

Also, this doesn't exactly fit in any particular scenario, but I gave the
Drake Guard the Steadfast ability, because otherwise at first glance it looks
like a RiPLIB violation.

Note: I am taking over maintenance of this campaign; any further changes to it
will happen in the following repository instead:
