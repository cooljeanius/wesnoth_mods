So, the scenario that made me want to edit this originally was S06, The Swamps
of Illuven. Elsewhere in this repository I have said that if I have an
insufficient recall list for a given scenario, I won't go back and replay
previous scenarios in the campaign, but will rather try to just cheat/hack my
way thru it. Well, I broke that rule here and restarted the campaign after all
for this one scenario. The edits to scenarios 2, 3, and 4 came on this 2nd
playthru. Even after getting a better recall list, I was still having trouble
with scenario 6, so I made some of my most drastic changes to that one. As my
commit message for it says, "I might have gone a bit overboard with making
Swamps of Illuven easier; I'll have to make it possible for Garrath to turn
back to evil if you don't keep paying him, or if you capture one of his
villages." After that I didn't need to edit again until scenario 13 (The Return
of Trouble), where I mostly just needed some starting villages, and then I had
another break until scenario 18 (The Portal of Doom), where I made Iliah-Malal
appear later and target Delfador less.

Note that these changes have been merged back upstream as of this PR being
