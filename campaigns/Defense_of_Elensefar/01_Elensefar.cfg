    # For gameplay I want the player to defend those two villages from the northern enemy's bats, which is why any unit can raise some walking corpses instead of just necromancers.
    #
    # Justification: Ras had been planning this siege for a while and has known for a couple of days that all the graves in Carcyn were emptied. He's worked out how to enchant items that will raise at least a few walking corpses, possibly needing him to be nearby to power the items, and that can be carried by the bats.
