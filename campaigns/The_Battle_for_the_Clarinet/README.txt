This was one where my edits weren't strictly for making it easier. Some of
them were for that purpose, since I was really tired of all my units just
whiffing and failing to do any damage to the enemy leader Wraith, but some
of them also made it harder, as I didn't think the enemy had enough units
for it to be fun, so I gave them some more gold to be able to recruit more.
The allowing of recruiting of mages can also be justified as simply being
for consistency purposes, as the hint suggests recruiting them, but then
the scenario never actually let you do so previously.
