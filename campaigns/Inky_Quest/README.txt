06 (Blinded by the Mists) I probably didn't actually need to edit; I was just
lazy and didn't feel like having to be safer with Flamy.
07 (The Divining Pool), on the other hand, definitely needed editing. On my
first playthru the island fish completely overwhelmed the undead before I
could even get close to them, and then overwhelmed me as well. Their growth
rate definitely had to be turned down. I might have turned them down too much,
though. Besides just making fewer fish spawn, I also removed their loyalty
so that the fish would run thru their gold quicker and not be able to recruit
as much. In 10 (Drowned Dwarves Day) the undead showed up too quickly and
caught up with me before I had a chance to make much progress, so I delayed
them a bit so I could have a chance to explore first. I kind of wanted to edit
11, too, for completeness, but instead skipped over it and just finished up by
editing 12 (Burial at Sea). I brought back the fungus-to-water transformation
mechanic to give the cuttlefish more favorable terrain to fight in closer to
the lich's keep.

If I go back and give this one another playthru I'll want to do something about
the weird spacing and indentation style used here; there's too much whitespace
which makes it hard to focus on the actual code.
