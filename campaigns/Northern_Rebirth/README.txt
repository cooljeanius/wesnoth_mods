First playthru done. I had major mixed feelings about this one. On the one
hand, all the different branching paths (as in, scenarios playing out
differently, like Krash getting an extra side, or Eryssa being hostile)
depending on who you have alive make me want to replay it to see some of the
different ways it can play out, but OTOH, that desire is counteracted by just
how much of a grueling slog the campaign is to actually play. Also, the
existence of Northern Rebirth Remake on the add-ons server kind of complicates
my thinking about where I actually want to go with these edits I've been
making... I don't really want to make YET ANOTHER fork when one has already
been published, but that fork is broken an has its own issues, so maybe I
should actually fork it after all? If I do make a fork, do I draw more from
the mainline version, or the remake? I'm NOT thinking of reintroducing the
"evil" branch like the remake does, but maybe adding a 4th difficulty like it
does would be worthwhile? I dunno.

Scenario-specific notes:
01 Breaking the Chains: No changes, although it could probably use some.
02_01 Infested Caves: Hoo boy, here we go. I increased the turn limit, gave
  Tallin more gold, allowed him to recruit Ruffians, took away gold from
  enemies, made the 2 troll leaders nearest the start passive so that they
  wouldn't get in your way to Camerin as much anymore, or kill you as much
  anymore either, gave the dwarves more gold, and added more villages to the
  map.
05a_01 The Pursuit: added more villages to the map, plus basic gold tweaks.
05a_02 Dealings: This one was mostly just a cutscene, but it also made level
  0 units unrecruitable anymore, so since I had made Ruffians recruitable
  earlier, I had to take them away again here.
06a Old Friend: I made Fencers and Heavy Infantrymen recruitable here. The
  story reasoning is that Tallin had just had Hamel make weapons for him, so
  fencing swords, maces, and armor also make sense as things he might have had
  him make. Gameplay reasoning for Fencers is because maps get so clogged up
  in this campaign that having a unit with skirmisher is really helpful. There
  isn't as much of a gameplay reason for the Heavy Infantrymen, but hey, why
  not add them?
07a Settling Disputes: added more villages to map, gave player and Stalrag
  more gold, varied the starting HP/EXP of starting units with difficulty
  to give Stalrag a better chance of survival, removed some gold from liches
08a Elvish Princess: increased turn limit, basic gold tweaks, vary radii of
  starting village capture areas with difficulty, have Atul drop some gold
09a Introductions: vary the type of some trolls with difficulty; give player
  an extra recall
10a Stolen Gold: gold tweaks, give player a few extra recalls
11a The Eastern Flank: basic gold tweaks
13a Showdown: lots of changes here, probably needs more. Basically the AI orcs
  ganged up too much on me, so I tried to tweak their AI parameters, but that
  didn't really work and Hamel's dwarves overwhelmed the orcs just as the orcs
  were themselves overwhelming me. In detail, my changes included: gold tweaks,
  an AI goal to protect Rakshas, AI goals to target Hamel separately from his
  side, some code from SotBE to keep Hamel inside his keep, and some additional
  villages in Tallin's encampment. After beating the scenario I went and also
  added some AI goals to the rest of their orcs to protect their leaders, too,
  and I split the giving of gold between Hamel and the other allied side, so
  that Hamel wouldn't get as much gold as I'm giving to the sides of the
  liches, but even with this second set of changes, Hamel still gets to Rakshas
  before I do. I'm thinking of tweaking the AI even more, or maybe giving an
  "attacked" event for Rakshas, to give him guards and more gold if Hamel's
  side attacks him before you do.
