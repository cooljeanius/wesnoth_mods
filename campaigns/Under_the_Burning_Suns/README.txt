Beaten. Writeup:

02 Across the Harsh Sands: I hate that mirage event. I had a dehydrated unit
  that I was moving towards it so I could rehydrate it, and then the mirage
  event kicked in and I was stranded and died. IftU handles the whole
  dehydration thing so much better; I should try replacing the dehydration
  mechanic here in UtBS with IftU's. I also did some gold/turns tweaks here,
  and left the pinnacle you're aiming for unshrouded on EASY.
04 Descending into Darkness: just gold tweaks
05 A Subterranean Struggle: no changes here, just adding an entry for it to
  note that I took the path here where you ally with the dwarves, and probably
  will want to do a second playthru where I ally with the trolls.
06a In the Tunnels of Trolls: gold/turns tweaks, make AI for first trolls
  weaker, make lava damage vary with difficulty, upgrade Rogrimir, and... yeah.
08 Out of the Frying Pan: gold tweaks, give player more dirt for speedier
  movement, tweak messenger event (still needs work), and save Sun Singers
  from death by flooding. I still want to find a way to make the flooding go
  more slowly. And when I say the messenger event "still needs work" I mean
  I only got thru it when actually playing by using the debug menu's "Kill"
  command; I only added the changes to the turn counter after the fact, and
  haven't actually tested them.
09 Blood is Thicker Than Water: just gold tweaks
11 Battle for Zocthanol Isle: gold/turns tweaks, vary AI aggression/caution by
  difficulty, have mermen give extra gold when you reunite with them, vary
  wounded Merman Triton's HP with difficulty, tweak number of bats. In
  retrospect after playing the final boss, I probably should have given the
  player an option to stick around and grind for EXP for their heroes before
  entering the citadel, that would require some extra work, though (further
  turn limit tweaks, a way to summon enemies to grind on, etc.)
12 The Final Confrontation: Yeah even after trying to weaken the boss here I
  still had to resort to using debug mode to make my heroes invulnerable to
  win; will require some further work...
