So, normally I wait until I'm done playing thru a campaign before writing up
a README file for it, but I was giving Spannerbag feedback about how I got
stuck in this, which resulted in requests for more specificity, so now I'm
breaking from my normal habits and starting this one early.

10 Revolting Peasants: basically just gold tweaks
11 More Revolting Peasants: again, just gold tweaks, but for real this time
13 Northmead: vary a lot more quantities by difficulty
15a Battle for Aitsward: OK so this was where I got stuck. It's the one with
  the annoying mushspores that require you to wear boots. What I did here was
  to vary the damage from mushspores by difficulty, and adjust gold amounts
  and the turn limit, but none of that was enough. Turtling in the mushspore
  part of the swamp is just unfun because it means you can barely move anywhere
  yourself. Even if you manage to force the enemy to step on the mushspores
  more than you, they can still overpower you. I'm not really sure how to fix
  that without changing the scenario drastically, so I just gave up. I'm aware
  that there's a branching path here, but I tried the other path as well, and
  I had separate troubles there that I haven't even bothered trying to fix yet,
  so I'm still stuck either way.
