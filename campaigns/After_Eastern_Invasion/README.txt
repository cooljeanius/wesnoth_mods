So, normally I wait until I'm done playing thru a campaign before writing up
a README file for it, but I was giving Spannerbag feedback about how I got
stuck in this, which resulted in requests for more specificity, so now I'm
breaking from my normal habits and starting this one early.

10 Revolting Peasants: basically just gold tweaks
11 More Revolting Peasants: again, just gold tweaks, but for real this time
13 Northmead: vary a lot more quantities by difficulty
15a Battle for Aitsward: OK so this was where I got stuck. It's the one with
  the annoying mushspores that require you to wear boots. What I did here was
  to vary the damage from mushspores by difficulty, and adjust gold amounts
  and the turn limit, but none of that was enough. Turtling in the mushspore
  part of the swamp is just unfun because it means you can barely move anywhere
  yourself. Even if you manage to force the enemy to step on the mushspores
  more than you, they can still overpower you. I'm not really sure how to fix
  that without changing the scenario drastically, so I just gave up. I'm aware
  that there's a branching path here, but I tried the other path as well, and
  I had separate troubles there that required their own separate fixes, so I
  still got stuck either way initially. Update: I got around it eventually.
15b Aitsward North Gate: added variance to gold and turns, tweaked enemy AI, added
  variance to the EXP of certain units, made certain enemy units cost upkeep on
  EASY, added traits to certain units, added a few extra peasants on EASY
15b2 Aitsward Civil War: added variance to turns and gold, added variance to EXP
  of certain units, added variance to limit on assassin and hunstsman
  contemporaneous recruits, and various other quantities
19 Fight at the Ford: basically just gold/income tweaks; also recall an additional
  unit on EASY
20 Favours: basic turns/gold tweaks
23a1 Goblin Borderguard: basic turns/gold tweaks
23a2 Southern Wolfpacks: basic gold/income tweaks
25 The Caveguard: basic turns/gold tweaks
28 Solstice: add labels to tunnels on EASY in debug mode, make some text a bit
  clearer, adjust Arrah's recruits, make highlighting of image more obvious,
  give player another village on EASY
