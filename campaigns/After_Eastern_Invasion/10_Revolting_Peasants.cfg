      story= _ "Eager to be rid of the Null Stone the Silver Magi urged Morn to depart with all haste.  Whilst sympathetic, the healers could not agree because neither Alduin nor the Crown were able to immediately provide escort.  However the Flame Magi, prompted by the Flame Custodian, were minded to support the Silver Magi.  After considerable and often heated debate, Morn was commanded to place the Null Stone in the temporary care of Earl Gweddry (who was somewhat familiar with the artefact) until a site suitable for permanent storage was found.
 
The deciding factor was the unexpected arrival of a small group of young Horsemen seeking to replenish their clan's holy water consumed in battles against Ravanal's undead who were happy to escort Morn as far as Saradoc.
 
Word of Morn's new expedition spread rapidly.  Several adventurous Mages requested leave to accompany him."

As the two groups exchanged news and tales, companionship grew between them.  The Horsemen were gripped and fascinated by Morn's recent exploits.
 
When Saradoc and their parting grew near the Horseman leader, Aegis, proposed seeking permission for his Horsemen to continue accompanying Morn (and hopefully thereby find adventure and fame).  Lacking escort for the remainder of his trip Morn agreed to a detour into the lands of the Horse Clans."

Though outmatched we rebelled, losing independence, leaders and warriors.  Our coffers are empty, our larders almost bare and the roads are guarded.  We are trapped.
