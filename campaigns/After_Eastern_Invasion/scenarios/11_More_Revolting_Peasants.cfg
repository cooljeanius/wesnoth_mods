# Pathways to test:
# 1 - kill Philch first, pickup ring and check that if ringbearing unit is killed everything works OK
# 2 - check that extended play ends correctly when ring picked up
# 3 - kill Philch first, pickup ring and kill Dedhed.  Should end normally


# NOTE: No silver ring or amulet logic, those items not in play here.

# First time the Town Hall or windmill is captured, issue appropriate dialogue and gain loyal yeoman
#
# At the end of this scenario the player must divide forces and choose who gets the Null Stone

Nor could they allow this pretender to continue besmirching the good name of their friend and comrade the true Earl Flynn.
 
The road was deserted.  No patrols challenged them.  Clearly word of their journey preceded them.
 
They came across a battered, dilapidated-looking settlement.  A few peasants worked dispiritedly in unkempt fields."
