"Gathering Materials" (4) was a pain because of the bottlenecks that often
blocked the path to the materials that needed to be gathered, so I upped the
turn limit in case the player got bogged down. In "Towards The Caves" (6) I
had some real trouble getting Alanin past the southeastern elves, so I gave
him some buffs. This means that Alanin is now lying in the following scenario
("Outriding The Outriders" (7)) when he says the Outriders are faster than him
(they're now the same speed, except in terrains that the Outriders handle
better), but whatever. I still managed to lose my first time in that scenario
because I wasn't paying attention to the turn limit, so it didn't make it TOO
much easier.
