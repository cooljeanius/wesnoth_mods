# wesnoth_mods

I am bad at The Battle For Wesnoth. This repository contains my edits to its
campaign files to make them easy enough for me to be able to beat, along with
other various tweaks I felt like doing. Based on 1.14.12; I meant to include
diffs against the originals, too, but I forgot to save those.

Versions of Add-ons based upon:
- Ashen Hearts: 2.41.0
- Defense of Elensefar: 0.4.0
- Flight to Freedom: 5.3.2 (BFW 1.14.0+)
- Inky's Quest: 1.5.5
- A New Order: 1.2.19
- A Fiery Birth: 1.2.0
- The Battle for the Contrabass Clarinet: 1.0.0
- Invasion from the Unknown: 2.1.5
