# wesnoth_mods

I am bad at The Battle For Wesnoth. At least, that's why I first started
editing its scenario files. Later I developed opinions on how WML should be
written and started editing stuff just because. This repository contains my
edits to its campaign files to make them easy enough for me to be able to beat,
along with other various tweaks I felt like doing. I only copied over the files
that I actually changed; all files that I left alone were left in place. This
means that these mods are NOT "standalone" mods; they require the rest of the
files from the campaigns I was editing in order to work. To use these files,
find where your copy of the relevant files are, and then overwrite them with
my copies of the files. Note that updating will probably overwrite any changes
you've made, meaning you'll have to merge in these changes again manually
after any update you do. Based on 1.14.12 to start with, then 1.14.14 later.
I've been meaning to include diffs against the originals, too, and I've started
to do that for the mainline campaigns now that I have a separate installation
of it, but it's slow-going and fragile (i.e., I'll have to remember to update
them), and I still can't do them for add-ons yet.
