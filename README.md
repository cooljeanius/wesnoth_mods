# wesnoth_mods

I am bad at The Battle For Wesnoth. This repository contains my edits to its
campaign files to make them easy enough for me to be able to beat, along with
other various tweaks I felt like doing. Based on 1.14.12. I've been meaning to
include diffs against the originals, too, and I've started to do that for the
mainline campaigns now that I have a separate installation of it, but it's
slow-going and fragile (i.e., I'll have to remember to update them), and I
still can't do them for add-ons yet.

Versions of Add-ons based upon:
- Ashen Hearts: 2.41.0
- Defense of Elensefar: 0.4.0
- Flight to Freedom: 5.3.2 (BFW 1.14.0+)
